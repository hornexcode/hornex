              We use web beacons on our Websites and in our emails. When we send
              emails to Users, we may track behaviour such as who opened the
              emails and who clicked the links. This allows us to measure the
              performance of our email campaigns and to improve our features for
              specific segments of Members. To do this, we include single pixel
              gifs, also called web beacons, in emails we send. Web beacons
              allow us to collect information about when you open the email,
              your IP address, your browser or email client type, and other
              similar details. We use the data from those Web Beacons to create
              reports about how our email campaign performed and how to improve
              our services.

              consent to the collection and use of Personal Information for
              those Purposes will be implied by use of the Services. If we

              purpose that was not identified at the time we initially collected

              Please note that if the new purpose is required or permitted by
              law, Hornex is not required to seek the consent of the affected
              individuals and may not do so. Individuals may withdraw consent to

              access to Personal Information in our custody for the purposes

              Any individual may request access to their Personal Information
              held by Hornex by contacting Hornex’s Privacy Officer in writing.
              After receiving such a request, our Privacy Officer shall inform
              the individual of the existence, use and disclosure of their
              Personal Information and shall allow the individual to access such
              information.

              In certain circumstances to the extent permitted or required by

              we deny an individual’s request for access to their Personal
              Information, we will advise such individual in writing of the
              reason for the refusal and they may then challenge our decision.
